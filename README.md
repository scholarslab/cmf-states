# Critical Making Fellowship 2025-2026
This project aims to visualize electoral voting patterns in previous presidential elections using an interactive data-sculpture. Each state is represented with a cluster of hexagonal cells equal to the number of electoral votes allocated to the state. The state-block will have two actions in response to input data: 1) light up blue or red depending on the party of the winning candidate and 2) raise or lower itself proportional to the margin of victory. The data on state-level electoral votes is from UCSB’s American Presidential Project website.
